# Churn Value Prediction
# Churn Prediction Using XGBoost

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using the XGBoost algorithm. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave a service or subscription, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures. This repository contains the code and documentation for building and evaluating the churn prediction model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying important features using domain knowledge and feature importance scores.
- **Modeling:** Building a churn prediction model using XGBoost.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and precision-recall curves.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model for optimal performance using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

## Requirements
To set up the environment, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
python>=3.8
xgboost
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should include features like:
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Service Usage:** Subscription type, frequency of use, duration, etc.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Logins, complaints, etc.

Ensure your dataset is in `.csv` format with proper preprocessing steps applied before training the model.

   ```

2. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
   - Update the paths in the code if necessary.

3. **Run Preprocessing:**
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

4. **Train the Model:**
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   Review metrics and plots generated in the `outputs/` folder.
